# Monte Carlo Experiments

Want to explore some of the variants of the monte carlo learning algorithm,
including on-policy and off-policy implementations. 


Racetrack example:

- use and compare multiple monte carlo methods.
    - questions: how does the effectiveness of on-policy and off-policy monte
      carlo methods compare?

Prediction problem:

- Use monte carlo for prediction. Here the blackjack example might be best.
  Done now! Can reproduce the results in the book. 


Control problem:

- Both on-policy and off-policy control for the racetrack example.
