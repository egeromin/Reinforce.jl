# Next Steps for TicTacToe

We got the success rate up to 0.98. Great!

Next steps to investigate:

- play itself
- exploratory moves -- does then number of non-losses against random player increase?
- tweak alpha
- decrease alpha during training so as to satisfy "convergence criteria"

Right now:

- if playing against random player, get lower number of non-losses than against slightly clever player.
- but, much lower number of wins.
